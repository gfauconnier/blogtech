          <p class="articleP col-12 col-md-8">Google has announced the launch of the first reCAPTCHA Android API as part of Google Play Services, aiming to better tell humans and bots apart on mobile.<br>The older versions of reCAPTCHA have been refined to create a version that can provide
            interruption-free, streamlined user experience – the Invisible reCAPTCHA in March 2017 – which means users can go through sites automatically. The API will utilise the newest Invisible reCAPTCHA technology, with it also being included with
            Google SafetyNet, which enables mobile developers to perform device and user attestations in the same API to tackle security risks of their apps more efficiently. This enhances the protection capabilities of Google Play Protect to monitor
            for potentially harmful applications, device encryption, and regular security updates.<br>“The journey of reCAPTCHA continues: we’ll make the Internet safer and easier to use for everyone (except bots),” wrote Wei Liu, product manager.</p>

            Store have grown over 70 percent.
            <br>“People everywhere love apps and our customers are downloading them in record numbers,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing. He added, “Seventy billion dollars earned by developers is simply mind-blowing.
            We are amazed at all of the great new apps our developers create and can’t wait to see them again next week at our Worldwide Developers Conference.”
            <br>Most of this growth has been driven by the ‘Gaming’ and ‘Entertainment’ categories.</p>

          <h4 class="col-6">By Blog Tech</h4>
          <p class="categories col-5"></p>
          <p class="articleP col-12 col-md-8">Google made several big VR announcements during its annual I/O developer conference including the launch of new tools which aim to further improve the quality of content.
            <br>The VR industry has matured significantly over the past year – so much that BAFTA has rightly begun recognising some of the best examples alongside its renowned awards for film and TV. But for every good example, if we’re honest, there
            are more terrible examples as designers and developers get to grips with this relatively new category.
            <br>Google plans on making VR development easier while also improving the quality of content in a variety of ways. The first is with an ‘Instant Preview’ feature which reduces the amount of time (and subsequent frustration) it takes for a
            developer to preview changes made to their code.</p>

          <h4 class="col-6">By Blog Tech</h4>
          <p class="categories col-5"></p>
          <p class="articleP col-12 col-md-8">IFTTT has become invaluable for connecting various products and services together, but it was limited to its large partners in the past. Today, however, the platform is opening its virtual doors to individual developers to build and publish
            applets for anyone. For those uninitiated, IFTTT (If This Then That) allows people to create ‘recipes’ which help to maximise the potential of products and services. For example, a high carbon dioxide level detected by a Netatmo Weather Station
            at home could result in your Phillips Hue lights blinking a few times or altering colour to remind you to open a window.
            <br>"Makers will be able to publish and show off their creations on dedicated profile pages."
            <br>Last August, IFTTT announced it would allow third-party companies to build their own apps and services using the IFTTT partner platform. The initial partners included Adobe and smart doorbell manufacturer Ring. More recently, Dominos jumped
            on board to have smart home devices such as Hue lights update customers on the progress of their pizza delivery.</p>

          <p class="articleP col-12 col-md-8">Stack Overflow has launched its official mobile application for Android and iOS platforms. The Android version of the app although fully-functional is currently in beta, with changes to user interface underway.
            <br>The Stack Overflow app enables developers to view, ask, answer, comment, draft questions, flag and vote on questions while on the go. Developers are kept updated about the status of the questions thorough push notifications. The app is
            different from the already existing Stack Exchange app in that it contains Stack Overflow questions and answers. The notifications for both the apps come separately and launch in their respective applications.
            <br>Stack Overflow has also launched Stack Overflow Trends, a tool to analyse ongoing and past trends in developer activities in mobile-related technologies. It has learned that Android was the most discussed topic on their platform after
            the launch of Android Studio IDE in 2013.</p>

          <p class="categories col-5"></p>
          <p class="articleP col-12 col-md-8">Popular UK-based small computer manufacturer Raspberry Pi has launched a new accessory which provides developers with access to Google’s advanced AI.
            <br>Artificial intelligence has received a renewed focus over the past few years; primarily due to the emergence of the IoT. Just earlier today, Amazon announced plans for a UK expansion dedicated to AI and machine-learning which will see
            400 “machine learning scientists, knowledge engineers, data scientists, mathematical modelers, speech scientists, and software engineers” being recruited to the company’s R&D centre in Cambridge.
            <br>With increasing competition also heating up from the likes of Microsoft, Baidu, and Apple, it’s clear the race to become a leader in AI is heating up. Today’s announcement offers a cheap method for the more than 12.5 million Raspberry
            Pi owners to get started with building smart devices which utilise Google’s AI.</p>

            <br>The app store of iOS has long been the envy of Windows fans. Microsoft has attempted to lure app developers into bringing their iOS apps to Windows 10 with the release of their ‘Bridge’ porting tool which makes it relatively trivial to
            bring apps from iOS over to Windows.
            <br>“We’re thrilled to unveil djay Pro for Windows,” said Karim Morsy, CEO of Algoriddim. “Our mission has been to open up DJing to everyone. By introducing our app to Windows users for the first time, djay Pro has become a truly universal,
            cross-platform solution for all DJs. With direct access to Spotify and a native Windows 10 look and feel, djay Pro is the ultimate performance tool to mix music on Windows.”</p>
